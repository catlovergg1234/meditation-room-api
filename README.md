# meditation-room-api
This project is for my mom.
My mom is interested in Budizm(I don't know how to spell it in english) and Budhists(People who do Budizm) do meditation.
My mom wanted me to create sign up/log in system for herself and her friends, he decided to do stuff like avatars, real-time text and you get my point.
So the day I wrote this we had a little fight(Me: Let's make app, My Mom: No website).
Either way, the API won't change anyways.
Sooo I'm gonna add to render.
render.yaml and requirements.txt are either meta data and (obvously) required modules.
